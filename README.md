# Recipe app

The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. This allows you to store ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and create a shopping list based on what you have and what is missing in the recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking, the app allows you to make them open to everyone so everyone can access them.
